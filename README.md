# interpretingInSAR
Notebook and associated files for an exercise in InSAR data interpretation.

This exercise was adapted by Gareth Funning (gareth@ucr.edu) from an exercise originally developed by Tim Wright of the University of Leeds. A longer, and more geological, form of the exercise is found in Unit 3 of the GETSI module, 'Imaging Active Tectonics', available at https://serc.carleton.edu/getsi/
